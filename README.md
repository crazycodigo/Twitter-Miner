# Twitter-Miner
We did an API call to Twitter and scrapped tweets. Then we used textblob module to analyse the sentiment of the tweets on a scale of -1 to +1.
This was used as a basis to classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral. The result was displayed in the form of a piechart and the final verdict was shown.
